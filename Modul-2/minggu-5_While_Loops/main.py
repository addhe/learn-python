# While Loops Example

# This program demonstrates the use of while loops in Python.

# Initialize a counter variable
counter = 0

# Set a limit for the loop
limit = 5

# Use a while loop to print numbers from 0 to limit
while counter < limit:
    print("Current counter value:", counter)
    counter += 1  # Increment the counter

print("While loop has completed.")
