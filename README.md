# Python Learning Project

This project is designed to help you learn Python through a structured roadmap. The project is divided into four modules, each focusing on different fundamental concepts of Python programming.

## Project Structure

- **learn-python**: This is the root directory for the Python learning project.

### Modul-1: Basic Concepts
- **minggu-1_Expression_and_Variables**: Contains exercises related to expressions and variables.
- **minggu-2_Function**: Contains exercises related to functions.
- **minggu-3_Conditionals**: Contains exercises related to conditionals.
- **minggu-4_Looping**: Contains exercises related to looping.

### Modul-2: Advanced Control Flow
- **minggu-5_While_Loops**: Contains exercises related to while loops.
- **minggu-6_For_Loops**: Contains exercises related to for loops. (Now includes `for_loops.py` with examples)
- **minggu-7_Recurssion**: Contains exercises related to recursion.

### Modul-3: Data Structures and OOP
- **minggu-8_String**: Contains exercises related to strings. (Now includes `string.py` with examples)
- **minggu-9_List**: Contains exercises related to lists. (Now includes `list.py` with examples)
- **minggu-10_Dictionaries**: Contains exercises related to dictionaries. (Now includes `dictionaries.py` with examples)
- **minggu-11_OOP**: Contains exercises related to object-oriented programming. (Now includes `oop.py` with examples)

### Modul-4: Final Project
- **Small_Project**: A small project that applies the concepts learned in previous modules. This now includes an improved "Guess the Number" game with difficulty levels, guess limits, and a play-again feature.

## Getting Started

To get started, navigate to the respective module and open the `main.py` file for exercises or examples related to that topic. For modules with topic-specific Python files (e.g., `for_loops.py`, `string.py`), you can run those files directly to see examples. Happy learning!
